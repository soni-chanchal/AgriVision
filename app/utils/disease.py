        Gray leaf spot lesions on corn leaves hinder photosynthetic activity, reducing carbohydrates allocated

        Common corn rust, caused by the fungus Puccinia sorghi, is the most frequently occurring of the two primary

<br /><br /> <h3><b>How to prevent/cure the disease?</b></h3> <br />
<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        Although rust is frequently found on corn in Ohio, very rarely has there been a need for fungicide
        applications. This is due to the fact that there are highly resistant field corn hybrids available and most
        possess some

        However, popcorn and sweet corn can be quite susceptible. In seasons where considerable rust is present on the

        be
